Sindre - programming language for writing simple GUIs
===

Sindre is a programming language inspired by Awk that makes it easy to
write simple graphical programs in the spirit of dzen, dmenu, xmobar,
gsmenu and the like.

Requirements
---

A relatively modern (GHC >= 7.x) Haskell setup and a number of
libraries available on Hackage.  See 'sindre.cabal' for specifics.
Sindre is developed with POSIX systems in mind and may not run (or be
useful) anywhere else.

Installation
---

Just run 'cabal install' and Cabal should build and install Sindre.

Documentation
---

Nothing yet, unfortunately, but check the examples/ directory for
sample code.
